# Solar System Simulation

This project simulates the dynamic movement of scaled planets 
within our solar system, utilizing Pygame and realistic physical 
principles.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/fabijannnnnn/Solar_System.git` 
2. `pip install pygame`
3. `python main.py`

## Usage

- Upon running, the simulation starts with the sun and planets already initialized.
- Use the resizable window to zoom in/out or adjust the view.
- Close the window to exit the simulation.

## Features

- Simulates planetary orbits and movements based on gravitational forces.
- Interactive visualization with adjustable window size.
- Realistic scaling and positioning of planets.
