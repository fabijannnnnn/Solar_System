# Solar System Simulation with Pygame

This project simulates the movement of planets in the solar system using Pygame and physics principles.

## Features

- Simulates planetary orbits and movements based on gravitational forces.
- Interactive visualization with adjustable window size.
- Realistic scaling and positioning of planets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install Pygame (if not yet installed):
3. Run the simulation:

## Usage

- Upon running, the simulation starts with the sun and planets already initialized.
- Use the resizable window to zoom in/out or adjust the view.
- Close the window to exit the simulation.
